Hero

In the hero folder in the templates, I used HTML and CSS to get the page to function properly. Like the carousel folder, the hero folder also contains an image, which must be presented on the page. To ensure that the HTML connected with the image, I had to use the element “<img src="hero.jpg". This HTML element makes the HTML file grab the image, connecting them, so that when I go to the hero.html page, I see the image somewhere along the page, depending on the coding from CSS that places.

In the CSS part of this, I noticed that we used CSS Selectors, Declarations, Properties, and Values. In one part of the CSS code, there was a command:  h2 {
        font-size: 44px;
        margin-bottom: 48px;
      }
The code inside the brackets is the Declarations, letting the code declare a change about an element. The red part of the code is Properties, saying that something is to be changed about the element. The Blue part of the code would be Vaules, the exact value of the property.


Carousel

The HTML code for the carousel template was very similar to the hero template. First, I noticed that the code uses an element code:”<p class="testimonial-text">”. There are a few parts of the code in this part. The whole code is an element, and the yellow is an attribute/class, adding additional info about the element. Also in this template, we had to use the  <img src="maria.jpg" alt=" Maria de Almeida" /> code to connect the image that was supposed to be on the template page to HTML so that the image could show correctly.

The CSS part of the template was just as simple as the hero template, we had a lot of CSS Selectors, Declarations, Properties, and Values, and the template was similar to the Hero template. I also noticed this code : 
“   img {
        height: 200px;
        border-radius: 8px;
        transform: scale(1.5);
        box-shadow: 0 12px 24px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.25);    }”
 
Which contains CSS Selectors, Declarations, Properties, and Values. I noticed how the coding was going specifically to the image, so CSS has to be able to speak to HTML so that this code can go specifically to the image.
